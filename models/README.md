# The different implemented models are here

All models have the following files (at minimum):

- `model.py`: model implementation.
- `basecall.py`: script to basecall using that particular model.
- `configs`: folder with different model configurations (training approach, hyperparameters, optimizers, losses, etc.).
- `README.md`: additional information about that particular model.
